# docker-registry-shell
## Introduction
**Docker Registry Shell** is a tool made with Python that abstracts the complexity of the Docker Registry API operations, thus making it easier to use. The user can get information about the repositories and references stored in the Registry and he can also delete a repository with just a command (instead of having to use directly the complex endpoint available at the API).

This tool can be executed in Windows, OS X and GNU/Linux thanks to NET Core.

## Requisites
In order to compile this project you will need Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017 with NET Core 1.1 installed.

## Usage
To use this tool, just invocate it using Terminal. You can get more information about the available commands if you go to the Program class (Program.cs).
